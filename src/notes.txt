// intersection coordinates between two paths

import { Path } from "paper/dist/paper-core"

// [0] is the index off the intersections.  [0] is the first
let intersections = path1.getIntersections(path2)
    console.log(intersections[0]["_point"]['x'])
    console.log(intersections[0]["_point"]['y'])


    path.smooth()
    path.simplify() reduces the nodes and memory usages
        tolerance: maximum error, default is 2.5
        I will set to 1


getNearestPoint(point)
    will find nearest 'point' on path
    will use to place next node
    

paper.project.view.onMouseDown = function (event) {
	console.log('You dragged the mouse!');
}
I got this to finally recognize the click
